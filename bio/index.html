            <p>
            I am a content creator: Compose <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/shiyi-bai-0727" target = "_self">
                music</a> and make <a href = "https://space.bilibili.com/522802777" target = "_self">
                videos</a> to bring meanings and inspirations to the world!
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a 4th year Computer Science student @ Cornell University. I really enjoy Cornell 
            as a place that witnesses my growth and records my happy memories with friends who are far more than solid.

            I am a global citizen: From Hangzhou, China; went to California for highschool and New York for college; 
            will go to Heidelberg, Germany for exchange program next semester 
            ... 
            and hopefully stay at Germany longer to polish my German and find something passionate to do!
