            <h1>Hi, this is Shiyi 诗意!</h1>
            <p>
            I am a content creator: Compose music and make videos to bring meanings and 
            inspirations to the world!  
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a 4th year Computer Science student @ Cornell University. I really enjoy Cornell 
            as a place that witnesses my growth and records my happy memories with more than solid friends
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a global citizen: From Hangzhou, China; went to California for highschool and New York for college; 
            will go to Heidelberg, Germany for exchange program next semester 
            ... 
            and hopefully stay at Germany longer to polish my German and find something passionate to do ;)
